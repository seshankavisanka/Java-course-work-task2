# CourseWork_SD2_Task2

## Description

This repository contains Task 2 of my Java Coursework. In Task 2, I have implemented the `Customer` and `FoodQueue` classes to handle customer details and food queues. Additionally, I have added a JavaFX UI to display the food queue and waiting list of customers.

## Task 2 Description

In Task 2, I have created the following classes:

1. **Customer Class**:
   The `Customer` class represents a food customer with attributes for first name, second name, and the number of burgers required. It provides methods to access these attributes.

2. **FoodQueue Class**:
   The `FoodQueue` class manages the food queue for a cashier. It allows adding customers to the queue and provides a method to count the number of customers in the queue.

3. **JavaFX UI**:
   I have also added a JavaFX UI to visualize the food queue and the waiting list of customers. The UI displays the names of customers in each queue and provides an option to add customers to the waiting list.

## How to Use

1. To run the program, you need Java and JavaFX installed on your system.
2. The main class is `CourseWork_SD2_Task2`, which contains the `main` method.
3. The JavaFX UI will display the food queues and the waiting list of customers.
4. Use the UI buttons to add customers to the queues or waiting list.

## Code Structure

- `CourseWork_SD2_Task2.java`: The main class that sets up the JavaFX UI and handles user interactions.
- `Customer.java`: The class that defines the Customer object and its attributes.
- `FoodQueue.java`: The class that manages the food queue and waiting list of customers.
